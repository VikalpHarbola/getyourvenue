                <h3>Non Wedding Venues</h3>
                <p>GetYourVenue is committed to assist you in finding wedding venues in Delhi and NCR region. Besides wedding venues, we also help you to find suitable venues for birthday parties, engagement ceremonies, anniversaries, corporate parties and other non wedding functions.

                <b>Let us plan the whole thing just as you want it!</b>
                <p>We can help you find farmhouses that carry a unique blend of the luxury of a five star hotel and serenity and calmness of a spacious lawn. Farmhouses are excellent for corporate parties and wedding ceremonies. We can immediately help you to locate farm houses in South Delhi, farm houses in Chattarpur and farm houses in GT Karnal Road with ample parking and outdoor space.</p>
                <br>
                <b>GetYourVenue is the answer to all your venue selection dilemmas!</b>
                <p>Whether you are planning to host a long anticipated corporate party or an inimitable birthday party in the near future, you can take advantage of our panel of professionals. Our experts have studied pros and cons of various Party lawns in South Delhi, Banquet Halls in North Delhi and Marriage halls in Central Delhi. Some businessmen are looking for exceptionally urban settings for a corporate party and few others long for something rustic to impress their foreign counterparts. The GetYourVenue team spends sufficient time trying to analyze your innermost desires pertaining to a party, celebration or event.</p>
                <br>
                <b>Birthday party, corporate event or anniversary Just as you want it!</b>
                <p>You don't have to compromise on the kind of facilities you want, total number of invitees and scope of an event anymore. You don't have to burn holes in your pockets to add grandeur to a function. Additional budget helps but we believe most people end up getting inferior service just because they don't search enough. 
				There are various occasions in life when we really want to throw a ball and make it grand. But most of the times, we are either not able to plan out well, or find suitable venues in Delhi. We understand the needs of a non wedding function, be it a birthday, anniversary, retirement party, baby shower or birth party, corporate event, a reunion, fresher or farewell party; we aim to serve you the best and you will agree with us the moment you receive a response from our experts. Make a phone call and start talking right away to one of our professionals or Let Us Know Your Preferences & allow us to help you find the perfect venue!</p>
