					page to prep it up for the D day! Hundreds of varied decor ideas can be employed to do up <b><a href="http://getyourvenue.com/venues/delhi-ncr/banquet-hall/0">delhi

					decor artist that can create unique and modern displays in your banquet hall colors. A truly traditional
					yet elegant decoration is the classic drape and adding these to your theme and you can be sure of
					creating a real effect. You can even decorate the plainest chair with material ribbons and fabric bows to
					make them work as part of the whole room decoration.

					<br/>
					<b>The Fun Filled Look</b>
					<br/><br/>
					<p>
					Why not add a bit of zing to your delhi banquet halls decor by hanging strings of faux crystals down the
					walls. Another way to decorate <b><a href="http://getyourvenue.com/venues/delhi-ncr/banquet-hall/0">banquet halls in delhi</a></b> is to have an ice sculpture that also doubles up as
					a way to serve your guests with a shot of liquour. Very dramatic and great fun. Along the same lines is a
					chocolate fountain.

					<b>Decorations that suit your budget</b>

					napkins & tissues for your tables. Making this small expenditure can render a completely changed look

					A great way to decorate and personalize the decoration of your banquet hall is to do some creative work
					with photographs of both families. Think wedding nostalgia and put up chic wedding photos and other
					pictures from generations that have gone by.
